event: Category Theory seminars in Cambridge


location: University of Cambridge
address:
  country: UK

#summary: An example talk using Wowchemy's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: "In this talk, I will introduce the notion of Gödel fibration, which is a fibration categorically embodying both the logical principles of traditional Skolemization and the existence of a prenex normal form presentation for every formula, and I will explain how this notion is related to the Dialectica construction. In particular, building up from Hofstra’s earlier fibrational characterization of de Paiva’s categorical Dialectica construction, I will show that a fibration is an instance of the Dialectica construction if and only if it is a Gödel fibration. This result establishes an intrinsic presentation of the Dialectica fibration, contributing to the understanding of the Dialectica construction itself and of its properties from a logical perspective. (Joint work with Matteo Spadetto and Valeria de Paiva)."
