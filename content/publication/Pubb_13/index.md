abstract: Fo-bicategories are a categorification of Peirce's calculus of relations. Notably, their laws provide a proof system for first-order logic that is both purely equational and complete. This paper illustrates a correspondence between fo-bicategories and Lawvere's hyperdoctrines. To streamline our proof, we introduce peircean bicategories, which offer a more succinct characterization of fo-bicategories.
