abstract: We provide a new description of Joyal's arithmetic universes through a  characterization of the exact and regular completions of pure existential completions.We show that the regular and  exact completions of  the pure existential completion  of an  elementary doctrine $P$ are equivalent to the  $\mathsf{reg}/\mathsf{lex}$ and $\mathsf{ex}/\mathsf{lex}$-completions, respectively, of the category of predicates of $P$. This result generalizes a previous one  by the first author  with F. Pasquali and G. Rosolini  about doctrines equipped with Hilbert's $\epsilon$-operators. Thanks to  this characterization,  each arithmetic universe in the sense of Joyal  can be seen  as the  exact completion of the pure existential completion of the doctrine of predicates of its Skolem theory. In particular,  the  initial arithmetic universe in the standard category of ZFC-sets turns out to be the completion with exact quotients of the doctrine of recursively enumerable predicates.
