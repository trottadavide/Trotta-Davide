abstract: The syntax of a host-core language is spitted in two parts, representing respectively a H and a C, embedded in H. This idea is rooted in Benton's  inear/non Linear formulation of Linear logic and allows a flexible management of data linearity, which is particularly useful in non-classical computational paradigms. Moreover, the host-core style can be viewed as a simplified notion of multi-language programming, the process of software development in a  eterogeneous programming language. In this paper, we present the typed calculus HC0, a minimal and flexible host-core system that captures and standardizes common properties of an ideal class of host-core languages. We provide a denotation in terms of enriched categories and we state a strong correspondence between syntax and semantics through the notion of internal language. The latter result provides some interesting characterizations of host-core style, otherwise difficult to achieve. We also show discuss some concrete instances, extensions and specializations of HC0.

This idea is rooted in Benton's  inear/non Linear formulation of Linear logic and allows a flexible management of data linearity, which is particularly useful in non-classical computational paradigms. Moreover, the host-core style can be viewed as a simplified notion of multi-language programming, the process of software development in a  eterogeneous programming language. In this paper, we present the typed calculus HC0, a minimal and flexible host-core system that captures and standardizes common properties of an ideal class of host-core languages.
