abstract: This paper aims to apply the tool of generalized existential completions of conjunctive doctrines, concerning a class Λ of morphisms of their base category, to deepen the study of regular and exact completions of existential elementary Lawvere's doctrines. After providing a characterization of generalized existential completions, we observe that both the subobjects doctrine $Sub_C$ and the weak subobjects doctrine Ψ_C of a category C with finite limits are generalized existential completions of the constant truedoctrine, the first along the class of all the monomorphisms of C while the latter along all the morphisms of C.

This paper aims to apply the tool of generalized existential completions of conjunctive doctrines, concerning a class  $\Lambda$ of morphisms of their base category,  to deepen the study of  regular and exact completions of existential  elementary Lawvere's doctrines.  After providing a characterization of generalized existential completions,  we observe that   both the subobjects doctrine  $\mathrm{Sub}_ {\mathcal{C}}$ and the weak subobjects doctrine $\Psi_ {\mathcal{C}}$  of a category  $\mathcal{C}$  with finite limits  are generalized existential completions of the constant true doctrine,  the first  along the class of all the monomorphisms of  $\mathcal{C}$ while the latter   along all the morphisms of $\mathcal{C}$.  We then  name full existential completion a generalized completion of a conjunctive doctrine  along  the class of all the morphisms of its base. From this we immediately deduce that  both the regular and  the exact completion of a finite limit category are regular and exact completions  of full existential doctrines since it is known  that both  the  regular completion $(\mathcal{D})_ {\mathrm{reg}/\mathrm{lex}}$ and  the exact completion $(\mathcal{D})_ {\mathrm{ex}/\mathrm{lex}}$  of a finite limit category $\mathcal{D}$ are respectively the regular completion  $\mathsf{Reg}(\Psi_{\mathcal{D}})$ and the exact completion  ${\cal T}_ {\Psi_ {\mathcal{D}} }$  (as an instance of the tripos-to-topos construction)  of the weak subobjects doctrine $\Psi_{\mathcal{D}}$ of $\mathcal{D}$. Here we  prove  that  the condition of being a generic  full  existential completion is also sufficient to produce a regular/exact completion equivalent to a regular/exact completion of a  finite limit category. Then,  we show more specialized characterizations from which we derive known results  as well as  remarkable examples of  exact completions of full existential completions, including all realizability toposes and supercoherent localic toposes.
