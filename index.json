They can be thought of as symmetric monoidal categories whose arrows are generalised relations, with enough structure to talk about domains and partial functions, but less structure than cartesian bicategories. The aim of this paper is threefold. The first goal is to extend the original definition of gs-monoidality by enriching it with a preorder on arrows, giving rise to what we call oplax cartesian categories. Second, we show that (preorder-enriched) gs-monoidal categories naturally arise both as Kleisli categories and as span categories, and the relation between the resulting formalisms is explored. Finally, we present two theorems concerning Yoneda embeddings on the one hand and functorial completeness on the other, the latter inducing a completeness result also for lax functors from oplax cartesian categories to $\\mathbf{Rel}$.","tags":[],"title":"From gs-monoidal to oplax cartesian categories: constructions and functorial completeness","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tobias Fritz","Fabio Gadducci","Paolo Perrone","Davide Trotta"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1693612800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693612800,"objectID":"492ada78ed6c5f8ecdf81a2d8e7996a6","permalink":"https://trottadavide.github.io/publication/pubb_8/","publishdate":"2023-09-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pubb_8/","section":"publication","summary":"Introduced in the 1990s in the context of the algebraic approach to graph rewriting, gs-monoidal categories are symmetric monoidal categories where each object is equipped with the structure of a commutative comonoid. They arise for example as Kleisli categories of commutative monads on cartesian categories, and as such they provide a general framework for effectful computation. Recently proposed in the context of categorical probability, Markov categories are gs-monoidal categories where the monoidal unit is also terminal, and they arise for example as Kleisli categories of commutative affine monads, where affine means that the monad preserves the monoidal unit. The aim of this paper is to study a new condition on the gs-monoidal structure, resulting in the concept of weakly Markov categories, which is intermediate between gs-monoidal categories and Markov ones. In a weakly Markov category, the morphisms to the monoidal unit are not necessarily unique, but form a group. As we show, these categories exhibit a rich theory of conditional independence for morphisms, generalising the known theory for Markov categories. We also introduce the corresponding notion for commutative monads, which we call weakly affine, and for which we give two equivalent characterisations. The paper argues that these monads are relevant to the study of categorical probability. A case at hand is the monad of finite non-zero measures, which is weakly affine but not affine. Such structures allow to investigate probability without normalisation within an elegant categorical framework.","tags":[],"title":"Weakly Markov Categories and Weakly Affine Monads","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabio Gadducci","Andrea Laretto","Davide Trotta"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":168912e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":168912e4,"objectID":"748e0f460eb1ff1c4db431ee2877d3a4","permalink":"https://trottadavide.github.io/publication/pubb_7/","publishdate":"2023-07-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pubb_7/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a first-order linear-time temporal logic for reasoning about the evolution of directed graphs.

In recent years, several proof theoretic transformations, based on G√∂del's Dialectica interpretation, have been used systematically to extract new content from classical proofs, following a suggestion of Kreisel. Thus, the interpretation has found new relevant applications in several areas of mathematics and computer science. Several authors have  explained the Dialectica interpretation in categorical terms.  In particular, de Paiva introduced the notion of a Dialectica category as an internal version of G√∂del's Dialectica Interpretation in her doctoral work. This was generalised by Hyland and Hofstra, who considered the interpretation in terms of fibrations. In our previous work,  we introduced an intrinsic presentation of the Dialectica construction via a generalisation of Hofstra's work, using the notion of G√∂del fibration and its proof-irrelevant version, a G√∂del doctrine. The key idea is that G√∂del fibrations (and doctrines) can be thought of as fibrations generated by some basic predicates playing the role of quantifier-free predicates. This categorification of quantifier-free predicates is crucial not only to show that our notion of  G√∂del fibration is equivalent to Hofstra's Dialectica fibration in the appropriate way, but also to show how G√∂del doctrines embody the main logical features of the Dialectica Interpretation. To show that, we derive the soundness of the interpretation of the implication connective, as expounded by Troelstra, in the categorical model. This requires extra logical principles, going beyond intuitionistic logic, namely (suitable versions of) the Markov Principle (MP) and the Independence of Premise (IP) principle, as well as some choice. We show how these principles are satisfied in the categorical setting, establishing a tight correspondence between the logical system and the categorical framework. This tight correspondence should come in handy not only when discussing the traditional applications of Dialectica, but also when dealing with some newer uses of the interpretation, as in  modelling games or  concurrency theory. Finally, to complete our analysis, we characterise categories obtained as a result of the Hyland, Johnstone and Pitts tripos-to-topos construction when  applied to G√∂del doctrines.","tags":[],"title":"Dialectica Principles via G√∂del Doctrines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maria Emilia Maietti","Davide Trotta"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"147107ed76cdabe7a029aabc10f17e5e","permalink":"https://trottadavide.github.io/publication/pubb_5/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pubb_5/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper aims to provide an intrinsic characterization of the notion of generalized existential completion of a conjunctive doctrine $P$ for a class $\\Lambda$ of morphisms of the base category of $P$.

The link between our characterization and choice principles is emphasized by the fact that an existential doctrine $P$ is the generalized existential completion of itself for all the projections of its base if and only if $P$ is equipped with Hilbert's epsilon operators.

The most important clause of the Dialectica interpretation is the defini- tion of the translation of the implication connective. It is well-explained in [1, 3] that the crucial point is that this translation validates two logical prin- ciples which are usually not acceptable from a constructive point of view, namely a variant of the principle of independence of premises (IP) and a variant of Markov‚Äôs principle (MP). The main purpose of this talk is to provide a categorical explanation of the validity of (IP) and (MP) in the Dialectica interpretation by using the language of Lawvere‚Äôs doctrines. To achieve our purpose we employ the tool of existential (and univer- sal) completion introduced in [7] and further developed in [6] to define a proof-irrelevant categorification of the Dialectica interpretation given in [8] in terms of doctrines that we call G√∂del doctrines. Then, we show that the categorical notions of existential-free elements introduced in [6] and universal-free elements developed in [8] provide a cat- egorical presentation of quantifier-free formulas and are the key ingredient to validate (IP) and (MP) underlying G√∂del‚Äôs Dialectica interpretation. Finally, showing that every G√∂del doctrine validates also the so-called principle of Skolemization, we can conclude the proof that the notion of G√∂del doctrine provides a complete categorical account of the Dialectica interpretation and of the logical principles there involved.\\\nReferences\\\n[1] Avigad, J. and Feferman, S.

This entails that comprehensive diagonals, full comprehensions and quotients are algebraic properties of an elementary doctrine.

Lawvere to synthesize the structural properties of logical systems [1, 2]. The intuition is that a hyperdoctrine determines an appropriate categorical structure to abstract both notions of first-order theory and interpretation. In some recent works [3], Maietti and Rosolini generalized the notion of hyperdoctrine, introducing that of elementary and existential doctrine, which allows specifying that of quotients.\nThe main goal of this talk is to present the existential completion of an elementary doctrine [4], its connections with some choice principles and applications [5]. In particular, employing choice principles, we characterize those existential doctrines which arise as an existential completion of an elementary one. Moreover, it turns out that an existential doctrine satisfies Hilbert‚Äôs epsilon rule if and only if it is an idempotent algebra for the 2-monad arising from the existential completion.\nFinally, we present various examples of existential completions, including the doctrine of variations on a finite product category with weak equalizers, the subobject doctrine on a finitely complete category, and the doctrine of formal monomorphisms associated with an M-category.\\\nReferences\\\n[1] Lawvere, F.
